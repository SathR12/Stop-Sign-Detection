# Stop-Sign-Detection

OpenCV processing to detect stop signs. Will run faster than neural networks but less accurate?


## Dependencies:

OpenCV

PyVision Package: https://github.com/SathR12/PyVision

Numpy

Pytesseract OCR: https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract 

## How to run: 

Install dependencies and copy the image path to detect stop signs. 

Works best with images, detecting stop signs in live stream is very slow and also detects inaccurately.


## Sample runs:
